Azure Functions is Microsoft’s **serverless** platform for running code in response to events. It’s a PaaS where you write just the function code and Azure handles scaling and infrastructure. As Microsoft describes it, Azure Functions is _“event-driven and scheduled compute resources”_, providing “scalable and serverless hosting for your code projects”. You can trigger functions on HTTP requests, database changes, message queue messages, timers, and more.

##### C# Function Example

```csharp
[FunctionName("HelloHttp")]
public static IActionResult Run(
    [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
    ILogger log)
{
    log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");
    string name = req.Query["name"];
    return new OkObjectResult($"Hello, {name}");
}
```

This C# snippet shows an HTTP-triggered function: when accessed, it reads a `name` query parameter and returns a greeting. Note the `[FunctionName]` attribute and binding attributes (`[HttpTrigger]`) define the function’s entry point and trigger.

##### Benefits

- **Less Infrastructure:** No servers to manage; Functions auto-scale to zero when idle.
- **Multiple Languages:** Supports C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, and others.
- **Flexible Triggers:** Use HTTP, Webhooks, Cosmos DB changes, Event Hubs, Timer triggers, etc.
- **Pay-per-Use:** You’re billed for execution time, so idle code doesn’t cost money.

Check out the [Azure Functions documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/) for quickstarts in your language. The docs detail that with Azure Functions you can “respond to database changes, process IoT streams, manage message queues, and more”. Serverless functions enable agile development of APIs, background tasks, and integrations without server management.
