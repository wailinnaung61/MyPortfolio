Joins are fundamental in SQL for querying related tables. An **INNER JOIN** returns rows that have matching values in both tables. In other words, it “selects records that have matching values in both tables”. For instance, to list employees with their departments:

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.name AS department
FROM employee AS e
INNER JOIN department AS d
  ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

This query finds all employee-department pairs where `e.department_id = d.id`. If an employee has no matching department, that row is excluded.

##### Common Join Types

- **INNER JOIN:** Only matching rows. (As above).
- **LEFT OUTER JOIN:** All rows from left table, with matching right or NULL if no match.
- **RIGHT OUTER JOIN:** All rows from right table, with matching left or NULL otherwise.
- **FULL OUTER JOIN:** All rows from both sides; where no match exists, columns are NULL.

> _Note:_ The `JOIN` keyword alone defaults to `INNER JOIN`. For example, `FROM A JOIN B ON ...` is equivalent to `INNER JOIN`.

Indexes on join columns improve performance. SQL Server docs note that an indexed inner table makes nested loop joins faster when one side is small. This is why foreign keys are often indexed.

For more on SQL syntax and examples, see the [W3Schools SQL Join tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join.asp) or your DBMS’s documentation. Properly using joins lets you **combine data** from multiple tables efficiently.
