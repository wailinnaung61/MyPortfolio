C# (C-Sharp) is a powerful **object-oriented** language used for everything from desktop apps to web services. It runs on the .NET platform and emphasizes _readability_ and maintainability. Experienced .NET developers follow style guidelines to make code consistent. For example, Microsoft recommends using C# type keywords (`int`, `string`, etc.) instead of full .NET types (`System.Int32`, `System.String`) to keep code concise. By adhering to naming conventions (PascalCase for types, camelCase for variables), your code is more self-documenting.

##### Key Practices

- **Use Language Keywords:** Prefer `string`, `int`, etc., rather than `System.String`, `System.Int32`.
- **Consistent Naming:** Class names in PascalCase (e.g. `OrderProcessor`), methods in PascalCase, parameters in camelCase (e.g. `customerId`).
- **`var` Usage:** Use `var` only when the variableâ€™s type is obvious from context (e.g. `var count = 5;` vs `var reader = new StreamReader(path);`).
- **String Interpolation:** Favor string interpolation (`$"Hello, {name}"`) over concatenation for cleaner code.

```csharp
public class UserManager
{
    public string GetUserName(int userId)
    {
        var name = $"User_{userId}";
        Console.WriteLine($"Fetching user: {name}");
        return name;
    }
}
```

For more on conventions, check the [Microsoft C# Coding Conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/) guide. By following community and official guidelines, your C# code remains **clean**, efficient, and less bug-prone.
