The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) provides a powerful way to manage AWS services from the terminal. You can script calls to AWS (S3, EC2, IAM, etc.) without using the console. Commands follow the pattern `aws <service> <command>`, for example `aws s3 ls` to list buckets. As an illustration, AWS docs show using `aws s3 mb` to make a bucket:

```bash
# Create a new S3 bucket
aws s3 mb s3://my-bucket-name

# List all S3 buckets
aws s3 ls
```

##### Benefits and Tips

- **Automation:** Combine CLI commands in scripts or CI/CD pipelines to automate deployments.
- **Powerful Options:** Each command has flags, e.g., `--region`, `--profile`, and JSON support for complex arguments.
- **Configurations:** Use `aws configure` to set up credentials and default region/profile.

For example, to upload files to S3:

```bash
aws s3 cp ./local-file.txt s3://my-bucket-name/path/ --acl public-read
```

This copies `local-file.txt` to the bucket with public-read permissions.

For detailed command references, see the [AWS CLI Command Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/). Using the CLI lets you manage AWS resources in code or scripts easily; for instance, the S3 docs note that `aws s3 mb s3://bucket` makes a new bucket.

**References:** Official AWS CLI docs and tutorials are great resources for advanced usage and scripting examples.
