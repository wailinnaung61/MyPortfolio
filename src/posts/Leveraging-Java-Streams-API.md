Java’s _Streams_ API (introduced in Java 8) enables **functional-style** operations on collections. Instead of explicit loops, you can use streams to filter, map, and reduce data with concise code. For example, you can “process data sequences without numerous for-loops” using streams. This means you can chain operations like `filter()`, `map()`, and `collect()` to express data transformations clearly.

##### Stream Example

```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Andrew");
List<String> filtered = names.stream()
    .filter(n -> n.startsWith("A"))
    .map(String::toUpperCase)
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
System.out.println(filtered); // Output: [ALICE, ANDREW]
```

##### Benefits of Streams

- **Conciseness:** Streams let you perform operations in one pipeline (filtering, mapping, etc.) in fewer lines.
- **Readability:** The code reads left-to-right like a sentence (e.g., filter names starting with "A", then map to upper case).
- **Parallelism:** Easily run streams in parallel by using `names.parallelStream()` for large datasets.

Streams don’t modify the original collection; they produce new results, helping avoid side effects. For more details and examples, consult the [Oracle Java Stream documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html). Modern Java code often uses streams for data processing, improving maintainability and expressing intent more clearly.
