React Hooks enable functional components to use state and lifecycle features. Rather than class components, hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` make code shorter and more intuitive. React’s documentation notes that _state lets a component “remember” information like user input_. For example, you can store a form’s input value or track a counter across renders.

##### Hooks Code Example

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Declare a state variable
  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        <strong>Count:</strong> {count}
      </p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this snippet, clicking the button updates state via `setCount`, and the component re-renders with the new count value. Hooks simplify state management in functional components.

##### Useful Hooks and Tips

- **`useState`**: Holds state in a functional component (`const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue)`).
- **`useEffect`**: Performs side effects (like data fetching) after rendering.
- **Custom Hooks:** You can write your own hooks (prefixed with `use`) to share logic.

For more on Hooks, see the [React Hooks Introduction](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). The official guide provides in-depth examples. Hooks are now the standard approach to handle state and effects in modern React, making components easier to test and reuse.
