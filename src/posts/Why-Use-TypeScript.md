TypeScript is a **superset of JavaScript** that adds static types. It offers all JavaScript features plus a powerful type system. The TypeScript handbook notes that a major benefit is catching “unexpected behavior” before runtime, reducing bugs. Since JavaScript lacks type checks, TypeScript can infer or enforce types, making code more robust. For example:

```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
  id: number;
}
const user: User = { name: "Alice", id: 42 };
// If we try: const user: User = { username: "Alice" }; TypeScript will error
```

Here, the `User` interface defines a shape. TypeScript will warn you if `user` is missing a property or has the wrong type. In contrast, plain JavaScript would silently accept that object.

##### Key Advantages

- **Type Inference:** TS can infer types (e.g., `let x = "Hello";` infers `x: string`).
- **Interfaces and Enums:** You can define `interface` and `enum` to structure code.
- **Tooling:** Editors (like VS Code) use TS for IntelliSense, even for JS code, improving autocomplete and refactoring.
- **Compatibility:** TS code compiles to plain JS, so it runs anywhere JavaScript runs.

TypeScript’s docs emphasize that your existing JS is valid TS. You can start by adding type annotations gradually. For a quick intro see the [TypeScript docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) or the "TypeScript in 5 minutes" guide. By ensuring correct types at compile-time, you make large codebases easier to maintain and catch errors early.
