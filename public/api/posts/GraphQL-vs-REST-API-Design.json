  "content": "\nGraphQL and REST are two approaches to building APIs. A key difference is how data is requested and returned. GraphQL allows clients to specify exactly what fields they want, whereas REST has fixed endpoints. For example, a GraphQL query like:\n\n```graphql\nquery {\n  post(id: 1) {\n    id\n    title\n    content\n  }\n}\n```\n\nreturns only the `id`, `title`, and `content` of that post. The AWS blog notes that GraphQL “returns only the data specified in the structure given by the client”. In contrast, a REST endpoint like `/posts/1` might return the entire JSON for that post by default.\n\n##### Design Differences\n\n- **Endpoints:** REST uses multiple URLs (e.g. `/posts`, `/users`), while GraphQL uses a **single endpoint** (e.g. `/graphql`).\n- **Data Returned:** REST returns data in a fixed structure defined by the server. GraphQL returns data in a flexible structure defined by the client.\n- **Typed Schema:** GraphQL APIs have a server-side schema (types, queries, mutations) that’s strongly typed. This means invalid requests are caught by the schema, producing clear errors. REST typically does not enforce schema on the client side.\n\nGraphQL is often preferred when clients need specific or varied data (reducing over- and under-fetching). For example, fetching a blog post with or without comments can be done in one GraphQL query rather than multiple REST calls. However, REST can be simpler for small or well-defined APIs. AWS’s guide suggests GraphQL for “large, complex, and interrelated data sources”, while REST suits simpler resource models.\n\n**References:** The AWS comparison notes that GraphQL is a query language with a schema, whereas REST is an architectural style for resources. It emphasizes that GraphQL offers clients control over returned data structures.\n",
